The best way to learn is through examples. So, let's create a sample project to see how to use the framework.

We will be working on a simple game where the player can shoot at a gallery to score points.

**The features we will implement are:**
- The player can move their camera around with their mouse or gamepad.
- The player will be able to shoot their weapon with the left mouse button or the right trigger.
- The player will have a score that will increase when they hit a target.
- The player will have a timer that will decrease over time.
